## Summary

This repository contains the complete, self-contained analytical pipeline for a genome-wide co-expression study demonstrating that **EIF2S1** (eIF2α) functions as a constitutive translational quality control hub in the human brain — transcriptionally coupled to ribosome rescue machinery (PELO) and proteostasis, while remaining independent of its own canonical translation initiation complex.

The central finding is an unexpected near-complete convergence between the EIF2S1 and PELO co-expression networks (**Jaccard = 0.526; Spearman ρ = 0.987; 559 shared genes**), identifying a closed-loop transcriptional axis that links translation initiation surveillance to ribosome rescue — two biochemically distinct stages with no known direct protein–protein interaction. This convergence exceeds even the LTN1–NEMF pair (J = 0.445), whose protein products physically co-occupy the 60S ribosomal subunit during quality control.

## Key Findings

| Result | Value |
|---|---|
| EIF2S1–PELO Jaccard overlap | 0.526 (559 shared genes) |
| Genome-wide rank correlation (ρ) | 0.987 |
| RQC enrichment | 8.0-fold, *p* = 1.0 × 10⁻³ |
| Proteostasis enrichment | 9.2-fold, *p* = 6.3 × 10⁻⁹ |
| Translation initiation enrichment | 2.7-fold, *p* = 0.17 (not significant) |
| Cross-stage coordination (I×R vs. random) | Cohen's *d* = 1.36, *p* = 2.37 × 10⁻²⁹ |
| Direct EIF2S1–PELO Pearson *r* | 0.930 |
| Agonal stress robustness (all models) | J = 0.502–0.530; rank preservation ρ > 0.998 |
| Cross-region replication | ρ = 0.81–0.94 across 5 brain regions |

| 2 | Configuration | 7-gene panel, 5 brain regions, 3 curated gene sets (locked) |
| 3 | GTEx v8 download | TPM matrix, sample attributes, subject phenotypes |
| 4 | Metadata loading | Region–sample mapping, agonal covariate extraction |
| 5 | Memory-efficient TPM loading | Brain-only column extraction (~2 GB vs. full 56K-sample matrix) |
| 6 | Region matrix preparation | Gene filtering (median TPM ≥ 1.0), log₂ transformation |
| 7 | Genome-wide correlations | Vectorized Pearson *r* for all 7 targets × 16,211 genes |
| 8 | Top 5% networks + 21 pairwise comparisons | Jaccard, Fisher's exact, Spearman ρ |
| 9 | Custom gene set enrichment | Fisher's exact for RQC (11 genes), proteostasis (24), initiation (15) |

## Analytical Methods

**Data source:** GTEx v8 (dbGaP phs000424.v8.p2) — RNA-seq TPM across 5 brain regions (BA9 primary; n = 176–246 per region).

**Co-expression analysis:** Genome-wide Pearson correlations on log₂(TPM + 1)-transformed data. Top 5% threshold defines co-expression networks per target gene.

**Seven-gene comparison panel:**

| Gene | Role | Network Context |
|------|------|-----------------|
| **EIF2S1** | Translation initiation / ISR sensor | QC hub (this study) |
| **PELO** | Ribosome rescue factor | QC hub (this study) |
| **LTN1** | RQC E3 ubiquitin ligase | Nascent chain processing |
| **NEMF** | CAT-tail modification | Nascent chain processing |
| **TMEM97** | Sigma-2 receptor | Intracellular transport |
| **HSPA5** | ER chaperone (BiP/GRP78) | ER stress/UPR |
| **SIGMAR1** | Sigma-1 receptor | Mitochondrial translation |

**Sensitivity analyses:**
- Cell-type deconvolution (53 markers, 6 cell types)
- Covariate adjustment (age, sex)
- Agonal stress controls (Hardy Scale, ischemic time, full model)
- Multi-region replication (5 brain regions)

**Functional enrichment:**
- gProfiler g:GOSt (GO:BP, GO:MF, GO:CC, KEGG, Reactome) with g:SCS correction

## Requirements

The pipeline is designed to run in **Google Colab** (free tier, 12 GB RAM). No local installation is required beyond uploading the script.

### Dependencies

```
numpy >= 1.24
pandas >= 1.5
scipy >= 1.11
matplotlib >= 3.7
matplotlib-venn
gprofiler-official
```

Install in Colab with:
```bash
!pip install gprofiler-official matplotlib-venn -q
```

### Data

The pipeline automatically downloads all required GTEx v8 files on first run:

| File | Size | Source |
|------|------|--------|
| Gene TPM matrix | ~2.6 GB (gzipped) | GTEx Portal (Google Cloud) |
| Sample attributes | ~15 MB | GTEx Portal |
| Subject phenotypes | ~200 KB | GTEx Portal |

## Quick Start

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload `MS2_EIF2S1_Definitive_Pipeline.py` or paste cells sequentially
3. Run all cells in order (~20–30 min total)
4. Results appear in `MS2_Results/` and `MS2_Figures/`

The pipeline's final cell (Cell 18) prints a complete verification of every number reported in the manuscript.
